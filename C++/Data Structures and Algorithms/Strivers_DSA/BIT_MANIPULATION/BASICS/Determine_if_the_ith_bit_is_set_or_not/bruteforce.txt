convert the number to binary
the count will be from right hand side, 0,1,2...till 31 at left.
the ith bit is set or not, we loop till that number. 
if 1--> set, 0 otherwise.
Time complexity=O(n)+O(i), where n is the number of bits in binary and i is the number of set bits input.
bit manipulation can achieve this in constant time complexity.
